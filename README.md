Notes on the QF web application

To start the server, you'll obviously have to have node.js installed.

Then you can either use node directly:

	node server.js

Or use npm:

	npm start

You can then use a tool such as SoapUI to test posting JSON requests to the application.


To run the in-built tests, use npm:

	npm test
